# Royal_Kitchen_Android_Java_Application

# IT2010- Mobile Development Group project.
During this pandemic situation, we were undergoing so many challenges for the past two years. To overcome some problems and make our essential things easier we decided to develop an Android Application. 
“ROYAL KITCHEN” is a mobile-based application that is used for managing the restaurant business. By using our app, customers can easily book their cabins and view foods in emergencies. There were so many apps regarding this kind of system. But our app saves time while choosing the cabins and food. Once they made a successful login the customer can access the menu page and make their bookings. This system helps restaurant administrators manage the restaurant business and help customers with food viewing and cabin booking. Our sincere thanks to our MAD Lecturer for motivating us to develop this project. 

Note: Above app is designed for academic purposes only.

Technology - Android Studio, SQLite, GitHub, Figma
